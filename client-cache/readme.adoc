= Client Cache

== Introduction

In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience working with a GemFire client cache configuration.

.Concepts you will gain experience with:
- Configuring a client cache XML file
- Defining regions both for local private use as well as connecting to cache server
- Configuring cache properties using gemfire.properties
- Initializing the client cache in an application

Estimated completion time: 45 minutes


== Start the Back-End

For this lab, we'll use the `server-bootstrap` module to start up a backend.

. Start the server-side processes using the `server-bootstrap` `start.sh` script (`start.bat` for Windows) inside the folder `cluster`:
+
----
cd server-bootstrap/cluster
./start.sh
----

. Next, run the gradle task 'seedRegions' to seed the regions with some data
+
----
cd server-bootstrap
gradle seedRegions
----


== Configure the Cache Client XML file

The client's cache.xml `<client-cache>` declaration automatically configures it as a standalone Gemfire application. At this point, the locator and server will have already been started and the listener is listening on port `10334`. In this section, you will edit the `clientCache.xml` file located in `src/main/resources` to perform the following tasks.

. (`TODO-01`) Define a pool configuration with one entry configured to contact the locator at `localhost` and listening on port `10334`

. (`TODO-02`) Define a region called `Customer` as a proxy type region using either the `refid` (region shortcut) or explicitly using region attributes. Similarly, create a region called `Book` but this time create it as a caching proxy type region.


== Configure additional cache properties

In addition to providing configuration information in the cache xml file, you can also define properties using a `gemfire.properties` file (also located in `src/main/resources`). In this section, you will use this file to define the logging level that will be used by the client application. Consult the GemFire User Guide's http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/reference/topics/gemfire_properties.html[gemfire properties reference^] for a full list of properties, and to find out the list of valid values for this property.

(`TODO-03`) Open the `gemfire.properties` file and set the log level initially to `warning`.


== Configure client application to initialize client cache

Open the `ClientCacheTests.java` file in the `io.pivotal.bookshop.tests` package (under `src/test/java`) and add code for the following methods.

=> Run the tests.  All four unit tests should fail.

Inspect the code.  Clearly the client is not yet configured.

. (`TODO-04`) In the `setup()` method to, add code to create a `ClientCache`. Use the appropriate method on the `ClientCacheFactory` class to set the `cache-xml-file` property to `clientCache.xml`.

. (`TODO-05`) Also, add code to the same `setup()` method to get the `Customer` region and assign to the class private field `customers`. Add a similar statement to get the `Book` region and assign to the private field `books`.
+
NOTE: You will not edit the test code itself, which performs the get operations. Details on how to make such calls to the region will be covered in the next section.

. (`TODO-06`) Re-run the tests.  The tests `regionsShouldExist`, `customersShouldExist`, and `booksShouldExist` should now pass.

. As an optional step, go back and edit the `gemfire.properties` file and change the log level to `fine`. Re-run the application and notice the additional detail that is output when running your client application.


== Define a local region

In this final section, you will define a local region and run a test to load and fetch data from it.

. (`TODO-07`) Open the `clientCache.xml` file and add an additional region called `LocalRegion`. Use the region shortcuts to define this as a local region.

. (`TODO-08`) Return to the `ClientCacheTests` class.  Update the setup method to obtain a reference to the local region and assign it to the field variable localRegion.

. (`TODO-09`) Finally re-run the tests and verify that all tests pass.


== Creating a DAO object for Book

To begin, open the `BookDao.java` class in the `io.pivotal.bookshop.buslogic` package in the IDE. The purpose of this class is to hide the basic operations involved in creating, reading, updating and deleting entries (the CRUD operations).

Note that the region is defined to store `Book` objects with an `Long` key as illustrated by the private field defined at the top of the DAO. The constructor is responsible for initializing the region using the `ClientCache` that is passed in. You will implement the basic functionality of this class in the following steps.

. (`TODO-10`) Before implementing the functionality in `BookDao`, open the corresponding JUnit test class (`DataOperationsTests.java` in the `io.pivotal.bookshop.tests` package in `src/test/java`). Take a moment to inspect the various test methods to see how the DAO is used.

. (`TODO-11`) Implement the `insertBook()` method. Use the key and book object to insert into the region.
+
TIP: Recall that there are different methods that can be used to insert an entry. Use the method that enforces that the entry can't already exist.

. (`TODO-12`) Implement the `getBook()` method. Use the supplied key to retrieve the associated entry from the region and return it.

. (`TODO-13`) Implement the `updateBook()` method. Use the supplied key and `Book` object to update the existing entry in the region.

. (`TODO-14`) Implement the `removeBook()` method. Use the supplied key to delete the entry from the region. Recall that there are two methods to do this. Either one is acceptable.

. (`TODO-15`) When you have completed all the steps above, run the test suite (`DataOperationsTests`). Make sure the GemFire server process (locator and server) are already running if you haven't done so already.

Congratulations!! You have completed this lab.
